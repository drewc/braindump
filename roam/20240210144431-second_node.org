#+title: Second Node

The First Node worked great and I can insert a space in the minibuffer now.

 =Getting Started with Org Roam - Build a Second Brain in Emacs=

 He gets a node list when he hits ~C-c n f~ for find node. Hrm.

 
I don't, but hitting tab does give me the completion of "First Node",
so moving on.

It gets exactly where I want to go next which is ~C-c n i~. That
allows me to tab complete link to [[id:A086D13C-DDDF-4019-A71C-606B0CDBE39E][First Node]].

I can just create a link to a non-existing node? [[id:CF17574B-4AAB-401C-89E6-C46F18272CDE][Third Node]]. I can.

Now apparantly there's a =[[]]= type =roam:<node>= syntax for org
links? This gets better and better.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-completion-everywhere t)
#+end_src

[[id:A086D13C-DDDF-4019-A71C-606B0CDBE39E][First Node]]


Still don't have it working. But really, A node for Org Roam in and of
itself is a better idea than my current exploration.

So insert a link! [[id:8CEF5C13-DB24-41A0-B664-51314C3C8304][Org Roam]]
