#+title: First Node

This is my first org roam node.

I needed to hit =C-q SPACE= to get the space character.

Got that from here: 

https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/org-roam-node-find-space-not-allowed-in-node-title/1847/6

It also says this works:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key minibuffer-local-completion-map (kbd "SPC") 'self-insert-command)
#+end_src

I'll try that after saving this first node with =C-c C-c=.
